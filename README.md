## üí° Why is optimization important in Machine Learning?

Optimization is the engine behind model training: it helps us find the best parameters, improve generalization, and reduce error. It's critical for:

- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature selection
- Training deep learning models
- Function analysis and sensitivity testing
